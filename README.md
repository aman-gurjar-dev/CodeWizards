# 🚀 Duality AI - Space Station Object Detector

This project was built for the **Duality AI - Space Station Hackathon**. We trained a YOLOv8 object detection model using synthetic images generated from the Falcon digital twin simulation platform to detect key space station items.

---

## 🛰️ Problem Statement

Detect space station objects such as **cheerios** and **soup cans** using synthetic data — enabling accurate detection in environments difficult to access physically.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

- Used **Falcon (Duality AI)** to generate synthetic training images with varied lighting and occlusions.
- Trained a YOLOv8n model for 50 epochs.
- Achieved **mAP@50 of 0.67332**.
- Deployed the model via an interactive **Streamlit web app** for real-time detection.
